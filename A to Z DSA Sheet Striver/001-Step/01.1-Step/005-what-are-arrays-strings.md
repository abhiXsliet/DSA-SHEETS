# What are Arrays, Strings ?

## Arrays:

Arrays in C++ are fundamental data structures that allow you to store multiple values of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. They provide a systematic way to manage and access a collection of elements.

### Key Concepts:

- **Declaration and Initialization:**
  - Declare an array by specifying its data type and size.
    ```cpp
    int numbers[5]; // Declaring an integer array with size 5
    ```
  - Initialize an array during declaration or later in the code.
    ```cpp
    int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializing during declaration
    ```

- **Accessing Elements:**
  - Access array elements using zero-based indexing.
    ```cpp
    int thirdElement = numbers[2]; // Accessing the third element (index 2)
    ```

- **Fixed Size:**
  - Arrays have a fixed size determined during declaration, and this size cannot be changed during runtime.

## Strings:

Strings in C++ are sequences of characters, and they can be represented using the `std::string` class or character arrays.

### Key Concepts:

- **std::string Class:**
  - Use the `std::string` class for a convenient and flexible string representation.
    ```cpp
    #include <string>
    std::string greeting = "Hello, World!";
    ```

- **Character Arrays:**
  - Represent strings using character arrays for compatibility with C-style string functions.
    ```cpp
    char hello[] = "Hello";
    ```

- **String Operations:**
  - Concatenation: Combine strings using the `+` operator.
    ```cpp
    std::string fullGreeting = greeting + " Welcome!";
    ```

  - Length: Obtain the length of a string using the `length()` method.
    ```cpp
    int length = greeting.length();
    ```

- **C-Style String Functions:**
  - Utilize functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcat` when working with character arrays.

### Example Usage:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    // Array example
    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::cout << "Third element: " << numbers[2] << std::endl;

    // String example
    std::string greeting = "Hello";
    std::cout << "Length of greeting: " << greeting.length() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
